This application represents my take on Email client, in Java Swing concepts. You can log in in this application, currently it only works with gmail.com accounts and you must use Application Specific password instead of your real account's password.
You can fetch your emails by criteria you desire, like age, size, is it read, etc. You can also sort fetched emails by sender name, label or date. You can also click on every mail and then you can view a content of an email. And content is in html format, with pictures, clickable hyperlinks and even unsubscribe button works!
